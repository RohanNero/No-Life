# ☣️ No-Life

Embark on a perilous adventure through solidity encoding and decoding!

## How to play

The game takes place right after a catastrophic event that leaves much of reality ABI encoded. You as the player must encode and decode hex strings using the `Hex Converter` and the `Decoder`, once you've gotten the encoded/decoded value, you pass it to the `Coding Ray`. The text box on the left side of the screen will update and a **Direct Hit** message will display momentarily upon inputting the correct value to the `Coding Ray`. If your answer was incorrect a **Zero Damage** message will pop up instead.

Reach out to me on twitter if you have any suggestions or comments, and thanks for playing! I hope this helps to teach you a little bit about solidity's ABI encoding.
